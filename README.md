In this repository, you can find the datasets, scripts, and plots used in my Bachelor’s thesis “Fine-Scale Recombination Maps of 
The Cattle Genome Inferred by Linkage Disequilibrium”.

The goal of the project is to produce and compare fine-scale recombination maps of the cattle genome. In this study, we extend and use a R package called *LDJump* 
to infer high-resolution breed-specific recombination maps for two cattle breeds. Given the two cattle breeds, it is questionable to see how the landscapes of their 
recombination maps differ from each other.
